# Bank Simulator
this thing takes a bunch of inputs in the form of customers with 2 attributes, arrival_time and service_time, to represent their arrival time and service duration at a bank. (atm they are hardcoded in because i didn't feel like parsing the file)

it's used to determine the optimal number of tellers to ensure customer's wait time doesn't exceed a certain time and that the tellers aren't over staffed
